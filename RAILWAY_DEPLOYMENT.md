3. Click "New Project"
4. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
5. Search for and select `taggaverse/vibe-trade`

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

In the Railway dashboard:

1. Go to your project
2. Click "Variables"
3. Add the following environment variables:

```env

PORT=3000
LOG_LEVEL=info

# x402 Payment
X402_RECIPIENT_ADDRESS=0x...
X402_NETWORK=base-sepolia

### Step 3: Deploy

1. Railway will automatically detect the `railway.json` and `Procfile`
2. Click "Deploy"
3. Wait for the build to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)
4. Once deployed, you'll get a public URL

### Step 4: Verify Deployment

Test your deployment:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_RAILWAY_URL with your actual Railway URL
curl https://YOUR_RAILWAY_URL/health

# Should return:
# {
#   "status": "healthy",
#   "service": "Vibe Trade",
#   "version": "1.0.0",
#   "timestamp": 1698624000000
# }
```

## Continuous Deployment

Railway automatically deploys when you push to the main branch:

```bash
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin main

# Railway will automatically build and deploy
```
